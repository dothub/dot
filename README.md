Overview
====================================================================================================================

<p align="justify">Distributed OpenFlow Testbed (DOT) is a tool for emulating large scale OpenFlow based Software Defined Networks. In contrast to <a href="http://www.mininet.org/" target="_blank">Mininet</a>, DOT can emulate large amount of network traffic without introducing any form of traffic skewness. This feature is achieved by distributing the deployed network across several physical machines to provide guaranteed CPU time, bandwidth, and network latency for the emulated components (i.e., switches, hosts and links). It scales with the network size and traffic volume. It also has built-in support for configuring and monitoring the emulated components from a central point. In addition, DOT can work on a testbed of heterogeneous machines, since it uses a capacity proportional distribution of emulated components. This is an outcome of an ongoing research project of the <a href="http://waterloosdn.org:82/index.php?title=Main_Page" target="_blank">WatSDN</a> research group at University of Waterloo.</p>
