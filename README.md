DOT (Distributed OpenFlow Testbed) is a tool for emulating an OpenFlow based Software Defined Network spanned across multiple physical machines. This is the outcome of ongoing research project on SDN for WAN at University of Waterloo. DOT provides guaranteed CPU time and bandwidth for the emulated components (i.e., switches, hosts and links). it can scale with the network size and traffic volume. It also has built-in support for configuring and monitoring the emulated components from a central location in the network. In addition, DOT can work on a testbed of heterogeneous machines, since it uses a capacity proportional distribution of emulated components over the compute nodes. SDN deployments on large WAN networks as well as datacenters can be emulated in DOT.
